# odin-recipes

This is the first project assigned by the Odin Project team.

The front page (index page) contains 3 recipe links that forwards you towards their respective pages

Each recipe page has their image, description, ingredients required, and directions to cook mentioned in them.

There is also a link to the home page at the top of each recipe page, for improved user-experience.

The ingredients required for each recipe is arranged as an unordered list whereas the directions to cook are arranged as an ordered list.

Currently, the entire website is build using HTML alone.
